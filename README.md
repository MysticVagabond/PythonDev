# Python Development
This is a repo to contain all my random Python projects over the years. Most were developed in 2012/13.

I will be updating them all as I find the time, if they still have the year in the name, they have yet to be changed.

## Pygame
A considerable number of the projects use the Pygame library to draw a visual interface rather than just text in the console.

If you want to run the projects follow the instructions here to install the library: [**Pygame Getting Started**](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

The documentation for Pygame can be found here: [**Pygame Docs**](https://www.pygame.org/docs)


## Favourites
My favourite projects, are the text based [Adventure Game](https://github.com/MysticVagabond/PythonDev/blob/master/Adventure%20Game%20%5Btext%5D%20-%202011.py), the [Digital Clock](https://github.com/MysticVagabond/PythonDev/blob/master/Digital%20Clock%20-%202013.pyw) and the [Snakes Game](https://github.com/MysticVagabond/PythonDev/blob/master/Snakes%20-%202013.py).
